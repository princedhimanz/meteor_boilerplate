## schemas

This is where data and form validation schemas for the application will reside.

This allows for a single reference to the data model of the application from both the client and server, and ability to apply global settings and parameters for the validation of all data.

It is important to note, that these are NOT database schemas.

These will include only data validation schemas for Meteor's Mongo DB.
