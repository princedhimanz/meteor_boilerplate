## Widgets

Widget components are components which provide small and re-usable features or data to the user. These componenets are used repeatedly across the application, in different views or modules, and are dependent upon and generally reactive to data contexts.

They may provide a simple data comtext  and simple display logic, but do not involve complex models or a high amount of business logic.
