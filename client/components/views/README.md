## Views

View components are components which contain only visual code.

They are almost completely lacking in any functional, business, or other logic, and generall contain markup for re-use throughout the interface.

Views may require or consume the data context set by the containing component or the application state.

View components generally remain very static after they are created, and are only modified as the visual design of the application interface is changed.
