## Containers

Containers are top level application components.

Although relatively simple or 'dumb', they define the largest view components and set the highest data context for the application. Often they are used to distinguish between user accessible and restricted sections of the application. The remaining components used to assemble the full view and state of the application will be included and rendered within these containers.
